FIRST WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT THE INDICES OF THE COLLISION POINT IS BEING UPDATED WHEN
WE COLLIDE A MESHED OBJECT WITH A SPHERE!"!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!1

THIS IS WHY ( ITHINK) OUR RESOLUTION ROUTINE IS NOT UPDATING WHEN WE COLLIDE TWO 
OBJECTS THAT ARE NOT BOTH SPHERES!!!!!!!

We need to generalise the collison detection routine.
 That is, we need to look at updating the angular velocity
 of meshed objects when they collide with spheres.

 We should experiment with this in the current situation.
 The two balls and a slab situation.
